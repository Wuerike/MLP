# Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network
 
## mlp.py 

Class that abstracts a MLP neural network that can have multiple neurons within multiple layers

## iris.py

Solves the classical iris dataset classification using its 4 atributtes and 3 classes with a MLP network

## ocr.py

Solves an OCR dataset classification using its 64 atributtes and 10 classes with a MLP network

## cross_validation.py

Applyes cross validation to the OCR dataset, being a more robust test of the proposed neural network
